### EQJS Practice

#### Purpose
* Keep a record of code written while reading Eloquent Javascript.  To return to, think through, refactor, learn from.

* Work on building a foundational understanding of JavaScript.

#### Note:
This exercise code was written both closed- and open-book: I have attempted to think through and rewrite what I've just worked through, opening the book when I get stuck.

In some cases the code here is not the exercises presented in the book but is rather additional code written as further study (examples are the recursive functions in towers-of-hanoi.js and rock-paper-scissors.js).
